# image_compressor
A simple python program to compress image using Clustering Algorithm (K-means).
This is a lossy compression method, meaning you can't convert back to the orignal image just from the compressed image. 
You can choose the value of "k" in the "main.py", based on how well you want to compress the image. Lower values of k indicate more compression but simulaneously, a poor
quality image.
